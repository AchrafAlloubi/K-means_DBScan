### To enter your image, you must:
###### 1/ Put it in the "img" folder
###### 2/ Change the path to line 77 for kmeans and line 116 for dbscan


##kmeans_clustering:
######you can enter the values you want then of K as well as those of repetitions in line 70 of the source code of the file kmeans_clustering.py

##DBScan_clustering:
######you can enter the input values namely distance_Around_Node and nbre_noeuds_min at line 110 of the dbscan_clustering.py file
######Just remove the comments from line 137-140 and 165-166 to see the result with Euclidean distance.
######For execution time optimization issue, I had to comment a distance.
